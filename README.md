# Bioinformatics in Python

This repository contains bioinformatics analysis using Python, focusing on **genetic variation analysis** with data from the **1000 Genomes Project**. The project specifically investigates genomic variations in the PTPN22 gene, which has been linked to autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

## Project Overview

- Extracts and analyzes **genetic variants** from **VCF (Variant Call Format) files**.
- Computes **allele frequencies**, **variant distributions**, and **population genetics**.
- Uses **matplotlib** for **data visualization**, including **histograms and bar plots**.
- Investigates **nonsynonymous variants**, focusing on mutations in **PTPN22**.
- Compares genetic variation patterns across **26 human populations**.

## Code Execution

To run the analysis for any gene, execute the provided Python script:   
´python 1000genomes.py [vcf_file] [sample_info_file]´
